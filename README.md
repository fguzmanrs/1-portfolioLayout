# Portfolio: Phase 1 

This is the initial build of a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS following a set of specifications and a style guide.

## User Story
AS A web developer
I WANT a deployed portfolio
SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients.

## Business Context
A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

## Portfolio Viewer experience:

* Given that an employer or client wants to hire a developer

* The user arrives at the portfolio landing page with an 'About Me' where they can learn about the developer.

* Visible on the top right of the navbar are links to contact information and spotlighted projects with corresponding repositories.
