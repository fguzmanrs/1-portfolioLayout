            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img class="image" src="https://picsum.photos/200/150" alt="Fabiola Guzman-Reyes">
            <p>Hello!
                <br>
                <br>If you are here clearly you are making some great life decisions, of which hiring me would be your
                best. What's my best life decision? Entering the world of coding. Though interested, for too long I
                lived under the misconception that making a career change to coding wasn't for me because of my age, my
                career, my responsibilities, etc.; all those reasons we find to stay safe. When I recently fond myself
                at a crossroad I opted to take a chance and now I am learning fullstack coding at UCR's Extension
                Bootcamp. Best decision.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will use the fullstack skills I'm learning now to work as a UX/UI designer. I find myself coming into
                the field with experience in teaching, social work, and literature that provides my projects with an
                important sociocultural viewpoint in our increasingly interconnected world. There is a need for
                universal design that caters to a wider range of audiences as the world becomes flat. One area I feel
                particularly passionate about and have experience in is reflecting an agency's mission by expanding on
                its accessibility and inclusivity initiatives. <br>
                <br>
                As driven as I am, I value a solid life-work balance. Taking time to live outside work and explore a
                wide set of experiences fosters my creativity, feeds my curiosity, and allows me to continuously
                challenge myself. Some of my favorite activities are thus traveling abroad, exploring art, reading, and
                learning new languages. It's this <em>Joie de Vivre</em> that I bring to my work.</p>
